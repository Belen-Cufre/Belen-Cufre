## Hi there 👋

I am __Belu__. I am 32 years old. I am a Full-Stack Developer now, but that was not always the case 😋.

I graduated from the School of Languages when I was 23 years old and became a Sworn Certified Translator of English.
I have been all my life looking for learning new things and I have had a wide sort of jobs 🦾.
I like working and I like learning.

## 🌱 The story of my life:

If I had to describe my strengths, I would say that passion-for-learning is definitely the most important one. All throughout my labor career I have been recognized due to my versatility to meet all the challenges I have been given. I am always looking for my own growing, whether it is a personal or professional one. If I can learn something new, then that is added value for me, no matter how tiny that piece of knowledge may seem. I am really perseverant, even more when I am motivated.

👯 I’m looking to start working as soon as a developer and I would love specializing on Backend.

## 🖥 I have learnt and I want to keep on learning:

 ➤ JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL.
 
 ➤ React, Redux, Styled-Component, CSS Modules.
 
 ➤ NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sequelize
 
 ➤ PostgreSQL.
 
 ➤ Git, GitHub.
 
 ➤ Windows
 
 ➤ TRADOS, WordFast, MemoQ

## 👽 As regards my personal being, I am Aquarius. We could be hours laughing and having fun out of my personality, tastes and life experiences. 
Anyway, in a nutshell I love:
 * listening to music 🎵
 * learning to drive my motorbike 🏍
 * singing 🎤
 * going out 🍻🍔
 * traveling ✈
 * meeting new places 🏞
